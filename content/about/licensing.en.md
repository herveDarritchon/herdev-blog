Use this page to clearly state licensing for blog posts (text), images, code snippets, the theme, and third-party assets.

## Summary

- **Blog posts (text)**: **CC BY-NC-ND 4.0**
- **Original images**: **CC BY-NC-ND 4.0** (unless stated otherwise)
- **Code snippets inside posts**: **MIT**
- **Theme (code)**: **MIT**
- **Third-party assets**: their own licenses

## 1) Editorial content (text)

Unless stated otherwise, my articles are licensed under:

**Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)**

### You may
- share links to posts;
- quote **short excerpts** with proper attribution;
- redistribute the post **as-is** (no modifications), with attribution, non-commercially.

### You may not (without permission)
- republish modified versions (even small edits);
- publish translations (a translation is a derivative work);
- publish rewritten summaries elsewhere;
- use the content commercially (paid products, premium newsletters, paid trainings, etc.).

## 2) Images: the common trap

Not all images are equal.

### My original visuals
Default: **CC BY-NC-ND 4.0**.

### Third-party images / logos / brands
Logos, screenshots, brand assets, external diagrams, etc. remain under their owners’ rights.
You can’t automatically reuse them just because they appear on this blog.

## 3) Code snippets: MIT

Code blocks intended for reuse are licensed under **MIT**.

Reason: **CC BY-NC-ND is a terrible fit for code** (ND blocks adaptation, NC blocks professional use). MIT makes reuse straightforward.

## 4) Theme code: MIT

The theme is software. If you put a restrictive license on it, you kill contributions and adoption.
So: **the theme is MIT**.

## 5) Fonts and third-party assets

Fonts and other third-party assets each come with their own license.
If you reuse the theme/site, you must comply with each third-party license (fonts, icons, etc.).

## 6) Permission requests

If you want to translate, modify, or use content commercially, please contact me with:
the URL + intended use + where it will be published.
