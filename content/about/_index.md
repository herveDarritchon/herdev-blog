I started coding at the age of 10, it was a long time ago, in the early eighties ! My first computer was a [Tandy mc-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_MC-10), a fabulous life-changing discovery. I remember it like it was yesterday, how you use 3 keys shortcut to type in "goto" or "gosub" :)

Then I grew older, as a teenager I was stil a fan of computers with [Atari 520ST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST), [Amiga 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500). The last one was really a breaking change ! 
Amiga with its OS, its Terminal, it is the real start of my Dev Life !

It was obvious for me that I wanted to be a developer and only a developer ! So after some studies in France and in England, I have join a telecom french company and since when I am coding in my day to day job ! Developing web app (shop and care), billing app (customer or business billing), ...

I have celebrated my 25 years of professionnal experience a few years ago, and since the beginning I have never regreted my choice.
