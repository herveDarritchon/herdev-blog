# A blog for people who like to understand how things work

> "Build. Understand. Refactor."

If you’re looking for yet another post promising you’ll become a “10x developer in 5 minutes”, you might get bored. Here,
we prefer things that actually hold up—while still embracing modern tools like AI: how to organize, how to decide, how to
keep a codebase readable as it grows, and how to avoid turning tooling into a religion. You can come for one detail… and
leave with a different way of thinking about your code.

Here you’ll find **practical articles**, **step-by-step tutorials**, and **lessons learned** about building digital
products—from architecture to code, all the way to the tooling that saves you time (or wastes it when chosen poorly).

The goal isn’t to “make it pretty”: it’s to **make decisions explicit**, **avoid common traps**, and **build foundations
that will still hold two years from now**.

## What you’ll find here

### Software architecture

As a project grows, **“small shortcuts”** turn into expensive debt. Here we talk about structure, separation of
responsibilities, and decisions that prevent you from rewiring everything at every new requirement.  
➡️ Explore: [**/posts/architecture/**](posts/architecture)

### The wide world of the JVM

Hands-on JVM topics: tools, libraries, languages—how to use them, and most importantly **why**.  
➡️ Explore: [**/posts/jvm**](posts/jvm)

### IDEs & productivity (VS Code, etc.)

Because your IDE and workflow are part of the final product: shortcuts, releases, announcements, and what actually
changes in day-to-day work.  
➡️ Explore: [**/posts/ide**](posts/ide)

## How it’s organized (and why it’s intentional)

- **Everything is grouped by section** under [**/posts/**](posts): each theme has its own landing page (so you can
  “browse around” without getting lost).
- **Bilingual content (FR/EN)**: quite often you’ll find both a ([**FR**](posts/fr)) and an ([**EN**](posts/en)) version.
  Content is French by default.
- **Different formats depending on the need**:
    - deep-dives (step back, frame the problem)
    - practical guides (do, configure, structure)
    - step-by-step tutorials (progress without skipping steps)

This structure isn’t here to look “neat”: it’s meant to let you **navigate by curiosity**, not only through a Google
search.

## Where to start if you’re new here

- If you want to **structure a project**: start with **Architecture**.
- If you want **useful Kotlin**: pick a serialization post or the first step of a tutorial and follow along.
- If you want a **tooling boost**: check out the VS Code notes.

## The point: make you want to dig deeper

You can read one post and move on… but the real value is elsewhere: **connecting the dots**.  
Architecture shapes your code, your code shapes your tools, your tools shape your speed, your speed shapes your
choices… and so on.

So go explore: chances are you’ll stumble on **one detail that unblocks you**, **a structure you can reuse**, or **an
idea you’ll disagree with—and that’s a good thing**.  
There’s (almost) always something here for each of us.

## A small bonus at the end

### Hugo & blogging platform

Yes, it’s a blog… and yes, the platform is part of the topic. You’ll find content to **build**, **organize**, and
**maintain** a clean, clear, scalable Hugo site (without ripping your hair out every time you add a new section).
