# A blog for people who want to understand — not just execute

> **Build. Understand. Refactor.**  
> Explicit decisions, honest trade-offs, and foundations that still hold up in two years.

You won’t find “magic” recipes here.  
You’ll find something better: **decision frameworks**, **reproducible procedures**, and **field notes** on what actually breaks when a project grows.

---

## What you’ll get (practical)

- **Understand** how the pieces fit together (architecture → code → tooling → delivery).
- **Decide faster** (with criteria) without lying to yourself.
- **Refactor without panic**: keep a codebase readable, testable, and evolvable.

## Pick your entry point

### 🧱 Software architecture
Structure, modularization, separation of responsibilities, tech debt, reversible/irreversible decisions.  
➡️ Go to **/posts/architecture/**: [Explore architecture](/posts/architecture/)

### ☕ The JVM (Kotlin/Java/tooling)
Useful, hands-on topics: tools, libraries, integration, hidden costs, recurring traps.  
➡️ Go to **/posts/jvm/**: [Explore the JVM](/posts/jvm/)

### ⌨️ IDE & productivity (VS Code, workflow)
What actually changes day-to-day: configuration, methods, and tooling anti-patterns.  
➡️ Go to **/posts/ide/**: [Explore tooling](/posts/ide/)

### 🧰 Hugo & blog platform
Building and maintaining a clean Hugo setup: structure, i18n, pipelines, editorial scalability.  
➡️ Go to **/posts/hugo/**: [Explore Hugo](/posts/hugo/)

## What you’ll (almost) never find here

- dogma (“you should always…”)
- tool worship
- empty checklists
- overhyped productivity promises

If an article proposes a method, it also says **when not to use it**.

---

## How it’s organized

- Everything lives under **/posts/**, grouped by topic: [Browse all topics](/posts/)
- Formats, depending on what you need:
  - **Analyses**: framing, criteria, decisions
  - **Practical guides**: do/configure/structure
  - **Step-by-step tutorials**: progress without skipping steps
- **French by default**, with an **English version when it adds real value**.

---

## Where to start (if you want a path)

- Want to **structure a project** → start with **Architecture**.
- Want **Kotlin/Java that matters** → go to **JVM**.
- Want to **stop wasting time in your IDE** → go to **IDE**.
- Want to **industrialize your blog** → go to **Hugo**.
