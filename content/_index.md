Nowadays every CEO, each company is talking about ***"Digital"***, it is the master piece every entreprise in the world. Behind "Digital" there is Code. And behind Code, there is "Developers" or ***"Devs"*** as we call us. For decades I have been developing softwares for a big french telecom company, spending my time between developing in Cobol, C, Java, Kotlin, â€¦ and attending meetings. I let you guess the percentage between these 2 activities :)

As developers we are the soldiers in the front line of the ***"Digital World"*** but we are also the Officer that set up the strategy and make some operational decisions. It is too many times forgotten by Devs but this is a true power we should be aware of.

Our World is moving fast but Computer Science is moving even faster. So, as a Dev, we are ***"on the Edge"***. In everyday we have to learn new paradigmes, new languages, new frameworks. It is quite a challenge and there some kind of gamble to make the right choice.

So It's been a while since I wanted to share my experience and my point of view on ***"Being a Dev"***, so I have started this blog.

I will talk about any reflexions, issues, new paradigmes and codes I encounter in my day to day work.
