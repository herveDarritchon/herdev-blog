Project creation and structure

This initial step describes creating the project, organizing modules (frontend / backend) and deploying to Heroku.

- Create a mono-repo or a multi-module repo with clear separation between front and back code.
- Use Http4k for the backend and Svelte for the frontend if desired.
- Prepare deployment scripts for Heroku (Procfile, build scripts) and document the build and run steps.

The goal is to have a reproducible project layout and deployment process.
